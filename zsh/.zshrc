# Some useful functions
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Description:
#   Extracts the latest version entry for each component from a CSV file.
#
# Usage:
#   services_latest_versions <csv_file>
#
# The function assumes the CSV has the following columns:
# component, tag, date, url
#
# It preserves the header and outputs only the row with the latest tag (version) for each component.
# The version comparison is version-aware (handles semantic versions correctly).
#
# Example:
#   services_latest_versions components.csv
services_latest_versions() {
    local file="$1"
    (head -n 1 "$file" && tail -n +2 "$file" | sort -t, -k1,1 -k2,2Vr | awk -F, '!seen[$1]++')
}
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Description:
#   Converts a CSV file into HTML <tr> table rows.
#   Skips the header line and processes each row into the following format:
#
#   <tr>
#       <td></td>
#       <td>component</td>
#       <td>tag</td>
#       <td><a href="url">Link</a></td>
#   </tr>
#
# Usage:
#   csv_to_html_rows <path-to-csv-file>
#   Example:
#       csv_to_html_rows ./data.csv > output.html
#
# Dependencies:
#   - Requires 'mlr' (Miller) for proper CSV parsing.
#   - Install it using: brew install miller  (on macOS)
#
# Notes:
#   - Properly handles CSV fields with spaces, commas, and quotes.
#   - Designed for quick generation of HTML tables from release version files.
